For Android Builds

To build for android platform, You need to install android sdk and ndk. You also need to export **ANDROID_SDK**/tools to PATH. On Linux, this can be done by

export PATH=**ANDROID_SDK**/tools:$PATH
The codec and demo can be built by

make OS=android NDKROOT=**ANDROID_NDK** TARGET=**ANDROID_TARGET**
Valid **ANDROID_TARGET** can be found in **ANDROID_SDK**/platforms, such as android-12. You can also set ARCH, NDKLEVEL according to your device and NDK version. ARCH specifies the architecture of android device. Currently arm, arm64, x86 and x86_64 are supported, the default is arm. (mips and mips64 can also be used, but there's no specific optimization for those architectures.) NDKLEVEL specifies android api level, the default is 12. Available possibilities can be found in **ANDROID_NDK**/platforms, such as android-21 (strip away the android- prefix).

By default these commands build for the armeabi-v7a ABI. To build for the other android ABIs, add ARCH=arm64, ARCH=x86, ARCH=x86_64, ARCH=mips or ARCH=mips64. To build for the older armeabi ABI (which has armv5te as baseline), add APP_ABI=armeabi (ARCH=arm is implicit). To build for 64-bit ABI, such as arm64, explicitly set NDKLEVEL to 21 or higher.



Such as:
1, open MinGW32 
2, cd into openh264/src
3, make OS=android NDKROOT=/c/Android/NDK/android-ndk-r9d/ TARGET=android-21
